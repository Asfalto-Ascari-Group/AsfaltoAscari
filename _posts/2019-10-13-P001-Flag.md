# An investigation by the FIA has been launched into why the chequered flag light indicator was shown early at the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix.

A technical timing issue in the Suzuka race meant that the chequered flag flew right after lap 52, when it was supposed to run in lap 53.

The [FIA Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/file/78014/download/26183) govern the manner of which the race finishes by a 'end-of-race signal' displayed.

## FIA Article 43.2 of the Sporting regulations state:

> "Should for any reason the end‐of‐race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given."

This meant that the results of the Japanese GP were declared official when the leading car finished the 52nd lap rather than the 53rd.

Which lead to the order of which drivers complete the race slightly shuffled resulting in drivers:

* Nico Hulkenburg classified P10 (Dropping from P9)
* Lance Stroll classified P11 (Dropping from P10)

This is similar to what happened in the 2018 Canadian GP with Winnie Harlow waving the flag two laps early.

Given that the FIA are uncertain as to why this happened and are currently looking into the characteristics of the issue, the increasing frequency of this matter will raise a few eyebrows within FIA.
