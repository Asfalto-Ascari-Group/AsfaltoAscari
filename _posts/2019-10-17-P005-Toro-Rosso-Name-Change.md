# Toro Rosso soon to be Alpha Tauri

In a rather interesting event, Red Bull's feeder team Toro Rosso has been **approved for a name change to "Alpha Tauri".**

Derived from the clothing brand under the same name, it is believed by Asfalto Ascari to **promote the clothing brand** and advertise it, increasing its prominence in the industry. 

Red Bull has consistently hinted at the idea of expanding from Energy Drinks ever since its entrance into extreme sports and motorsport.

This decision to change the name to promote the fashion brand is **in response to an e-vote which allowed the F1 Commission and FIA to vote** on whether the name change should be approved.

The vote results came up **unanimous** in support of the change. 

This is the first time the team has had its name changed in **19 years** after Red Bull bought out Minardi, with the new "Alpha Tauri" name to come **into effect in the 2020 season.**

The name "Alpha Tauri" is taken from a star named [Aldebaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldebaran "This link will take you to Wikipedia"), which is designated as Alpha Tauri, not to be confused with Alpha Centauri, the closest star to our Solar System.

Toro Rosso's current name until 2020 is the Italian translation for Red Bull, matching the prefix word "Scuderia", meaning stable in Italian, used to convey the idea of horsepower.

Whether we'll see Albon, Gasly, Kvyat or a new challenger, it will be a refreshing and exciting change to see Toro Rosso bearing its new name.
