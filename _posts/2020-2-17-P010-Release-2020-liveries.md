# An in-depth look into the 2020 Formula 1™ Car Liveries

As the 2020 season looms closer to the fans and the drivers, the teams have been working on the clock to prepare their cars for the pre-season testing and eventual racing on the global stage. One of the most captivating events of the Winter period is, of course, the release of the teams' liveries into the public eye. Here at Asfalto Ascari, we will be giving you an in-depth look into the teams and their liveries.

### Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula 1

Kicking it off from the front of the grid, Mercedes AMG probably has the most exciting livery, behind Toro Rosso's overhaul to Alpha Tauri. For the 2020 season, Mercedes picked up a new "principal partner" INEOS, as part of a five-year deal to be featured on Mercedes AMG Formula 1 liveries. This sponsorship deal (costing approx. £100m GBP, according to *the Independent*,) includes a new rose-red trim around the car, a nod to INEOS' main colors in other sports, including its title sponsorships for cycling teams. This red trim gives a very bold look to the car, almost acting as a border for where the livery ends. In combination with the Petronas Blue and other base colors, it feels reminiscent of sports teams like West Ham or Aston Villa, although this is most likely unintentional.

As seen from the image above, the new livery also has a much more defined blue streak, whereas the streak on the previous car was much softer and sleek. This in combination with the other harsh angles and swooping trims creates a much more sharp, interesting and performance-related paint job for the car.

Furthermore, the Mercedes tri-symbols have been enlarged and the commemoration to the late Niki Lauda has been retained. The Petronas symbol has also had a literal facelift as it has been raised from its previously droopy positioning on the side of the car covering the intake.

### Scuderia Ferrari

Although sleek and stylish, Ferrari hasn't gone for much of a change since its 2019 car. Their main change can be seen from the bottom trim of the car and the prominence of the apparent dark underbelly of Ferrari's new car. The black trim swoops from the engine intake and upwards, blending into the shadow below the car itself. As well as this, they've removed the black area on the tailfin and replaced it with the car number, making the car seem less scattered and quite whole overall. As a finishing touch, Ferrari has also added the famous Italian flag colors just to the side of the cockpit above the trim, almost a homage to the 2018 liveries and beyond which featured the same colored stripes on the tailfin.

### Red-Bull Racing Honda

RedBull has gone quiet with this one. In the interval year before the 2021 rule change, many of the teams haven't gone for anything drastic to allow the hype to take effect after the end of the 2020 season. So today we're being gifted with a new and interesting touchup for the car. Looking straight at the car itself we can tell that it's been slimmed quite drastically from its previous version. The car also had a similar facelift to the title logo as Mercedes, lifting and enlarging the RedBull logo to fill more of the intake cover and be more noticeable in the car. To conclude their new livery, RedBull increased the size of their engine supplier, Honda, to take up more space on the nose.

### McLaren Racing

McLaren seems to be going matte. In a surprise turn of events, McLaren has followed in the footsteps of the likes of RedBull and moved to use matte paint instead of going for the previously used glossy paint job from last year. McLaren has revitalized their livery from the previous year and went for a very modern take on McLaren as a whole, having the title sponsor under a glossy gradient of blue with the base color in matte orange. They've also very clearly gone for a horizontal style for the car, progressing from 2019's sharp two-tone triangles, now having a loud and clear blue ray of color treat both the top and bottom of the car throughout. The signature red spoiler still sees itself on McLaren's rear, continuing to use sponsor Huski Chocolate for the next year on. Overall, McLaren is making strides to increase the aesthetic appeal of the already beautiful Formula 1 car.

### Alpha-Tauri

The new kid on the block, Alpha Tauri, have put their clothing brand's heart into the car. Both in front of the cockpit and on the front wing, it reads "Fits body and mind", a nod to the origin of the Alpha Tauri brand as a clothing company tailored to fit comfortably physically and emotionally. The car itself feels like a stripped back, black and white version of the Toro Rosso and RedBulls we've had before, creating this cleaner and smarter look for RedBull's junior feeder team. Pure white coloration in-fact has been quite rare in Formula 1, only being partially used for Williams over time. Alpha Tauri is one of the first in a long time to return to this virtuous color scheme.

However, it's not without its merit on the rest of the darker decals, too. It almost acts as an oxymoron between the two sides of Alpha Tauri, presenting from the front its clean and honorable perspective, while strewn across the engine bay is a strong representation of the company logo, and the characteristic bull which can be found in the overarching conglomerate elsewhere, portraying a feeling of power, sensation, and strength for this new team shining out of the ashes.

Finally, at the bottom, Honda has found its way to be center-stage on the bottom of the intake cover of each side of the car, reminding the audience of the people behind the car's power.

### Haas Formula 1

Looking at this masterpiece, the first thing that comes to mind is the BAR-Honda cars of the 2000s. Haas have returned to their previous color scheme after the spate of issues it had in 2019 with title sponsor Rich Energy, which eventually saw the company be dropped mid-season after the founder & CEO William Storey reacted emotionally throughout the championship on social media and in person, directing attacks toward the RedBull, as if like a younger, more jealous sibling.

Haas' overhaul of the livery is then not without surprise. However, it's also not without merit. Haas has knocked it out of the park with this one, creating a captivating blend between the black underside of the nose into the metallic white and red trim of the upside. The company is looking for a much better season this year, and this livery has proven that Haas is pushing for it.

### BWT Racing Point

Coming in mere hours ago, the Racing Point livery has finally been fully announced. After previously being leaked on social media by an unknown source a day prior, the team still delivered the reveal on the plan and showcased the new livery. Compared to the 2019 version, we can see that BWT has become the new title sponsor for Racing Point. strewn across both sides of the livery and scattered everywhere else, BWT has taken over the vast majority of sponsorship on the car, leaving just a few on the car's nose and sides for smaller sponsorship deals with Racing Point. This move likely means another boost in funding alongside the already high funds from billionaire Lawrence Stroll, which hopefully spells some positive news for the team who have been struggling to get through the pack.

### Rokit Williams Racing

To round off our current liveries which have been revealed, Williams has thrown a lot more color onto their car than the previous year. The red comes as no surprise as Rokit has gained more reputation as Williams' title sponsor over 2019, allowing Williams to introduce the company's brand further onto the car's surface. This is good news for the team as evidently, they have had issues finding many other sponsorships for this season. Likely to be nicknamed the "toothpaste" car, the paint job matches very well to the namesake due to its paint job and how it swirls around the car like a cylinder. It's also a reminder of the traditional Williams of the 80s and 90s, as well as the BMW-Williams deal, which all featured a signature blue swoop in conjunction with white flooding the majority of the car. As well as that, the piece of the puzzle which makes it so different is the Rokit's red engine intake cover, which can remind one of the days of the Canon sponsorship of days gone.

## Unreleased Liveries

### Alfa-Romeo Racing

Expected to be officially released on the 19th of February, the Alfa Romeo for 2020 has had a shakedown by Raikonnen and Giovinnazi at Fiorano race track in Italy. The livery given is unlikely to be the final piece, however, it is a very aesthetically pleasing snake-skin themed livery, with the Alfa logo being presented in a heart-shaped pattern on the sides of the car, likely a homage to Valentine's day - the day the shakedown occurred.

### Renault Formula 1

In a teaser-style video, Renault has shown an all-new and all-black style to complement the new decade. Removing its yellow streaks, all that remains of the yellow coloration will be the driver numbers and a few small stripes around the edges of the car. It is also suspected that Renault has gone for a more gold color than previously, coming out with a much less bright yellow, and instead of looking metallic and slight - which goes with the matte finish on the black coating.

Renault is expected to release their new "testing livery" in the pre-season testing period in the weeks to come. It is unknown whether Renault is planning this to be their season livery or if it's a special livery to present the car until we land in Melbourne to commence the season.
