# Renault disqualified from the Japanese GP after FIA Ruling that team was in breach of sporting reglations.

Following an investigation by a protest created by **Racing Point**, **Daniel Riccardo** & **Nico Hülkenberg** have been disqualified from the Japanese GP. Meaning their respective 6th and 9th place are invalidated.

## The Protest

A protest was created by Racing Point F1 against Renault, claiming that Renault had been using a preset lap-distance dependent brake bias system that would go against the FIA technical regulations `8.6.3`, `11.1.3` and `11.1.4`.

> 8.6.3 : Any alteration of the driver’s controls may only be commanded by direct, deliberate and primary driver actions

> 11.1.3 :  Any powered device, other than the system referred to in Article 11.9, which is capable of altering the configuration or affecting the performance of any part of the brake system is forbidden.

> 11.1.4 : Any change to, or modulation of, the brake system [...] must be made by the driver's direct physical input [...] and may not be pre‐set.

Racing Point further argued that such system existing would go against the FIA sporting regulation `27.1` as well.

> 27.1 The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.

The stewards ruled that the technical regulations (8.6.3, 11.1.3 and 11.1.4) were not in violation of the regulations and rather commented that "innovative solutions to exploit certain ambiguities" were made legally which would suggest that there was no preset bias system which Racing Point alleged Renault to have.

But however Renault was ruled to be in breach of the sporting regulations when evidence showing in-car footage of the driver's brake bias number autonomously changing without the drivers direct input, falling faul of sporting regulation `27.1`.

Stewards' Findings & Conclusions

> The rear brake controller software used by Renault is an integral part of the control system referred to in Article 11.9 FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. As such, it is used in compliance with Article 11.1.3 and 11.1.4 of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.  

> The described control system is not pre-set, lap distance-dependent as alleged [by Racing Point].  

> Renault drivers use buttons mounted on the steering wheel to control brake balance in compliance with Article 8.6.3 FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. These are connected to the FIA Standard ECU.  

> Given the above, the Stewards conclude that while Renault used innovative solutions to exploit certain ambiguities in the Technical Regulations and other supporting documents, their system does not breach any current Technical Regulation.

Due to the unique nature of this issue, Renault have been given a extended deadline to appeal the decision made by the FIA Stewards by Thursday 10:00 local time in Mexico.
