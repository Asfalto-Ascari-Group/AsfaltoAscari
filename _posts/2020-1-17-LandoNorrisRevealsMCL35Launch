# In a livestream broadcasted on the McLaren YouTube Channel, F1 driver Lando Norris has slipped his tongue.

During the broadcast named "Lando's YouTube Takeover", he walks around the McLaren campus and walks into a meeting regarding the MCL35.

> "MCL35 Car Launch - Confidential"

>"I'm live, don't show me your papers or anything.."

They talk about Lando Norris visiting Las Vegas and the team discuss their holidays.

>"Alright. So what's the meeting about? Car launch? I heard it's on the 13th of Feb.. It is right? Zak told me it's on the thirteenth."

The camera goes off, and the reveal is so Tom Holland-esque.

### McLaren join the following teams in announcing the release date of their car:
- Ferrari (11 February)
- Renault (12 February)
- AlphaTauri (14 February)
- Mercedes (14 February)
