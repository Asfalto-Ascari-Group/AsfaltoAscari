# Behind the Scenes with Formula One's Track Sensors

Track Sensors were first introduced by Formula 1 in 2015 to find solutions that help enforce track limits with electronic ideas, so that consistency was placed towards the enforcement of sanctions.  

The system works by placing sensors on the edge of the track at turns mainly where runoff areas were the same height as the track kerbs.

For every race - these sensors have to be removed and collected for use another time, for the average Formula Track there are a several dozen sensors scattered around.

> [People] have no clue the volume and effort put in place.

Precisely positioned holes are excavated from the track ground and pressured air is blown into the hole - clearing out the debris created from the excavation and the sensor is fed into the hole and put in place by a chemical bond.

These track sensors not only provide indication of when track limits are exceeded but feed crucial data to extract race performance statistics and predictive performance modelling - giving both the FIA and fans an insight into split second decisions and strategies from teams and drivers. Most of this data goes towards a service created by Amazon. (Amazon Web Services)

> Formula 1 uses AWS’s machine learning and data-analytics services to power F1 Insights – the technology used to enhance race strategies, data tracking systems, and digital broadcast.
