# Daniel Riccardo is to be taking the seat next to Lando Norris for McLaren in 2021. Replacing Carlos Sainz who is moving to Ferrari.

This switch was announced in a surprise amalgamation of media announcements.

The decision to create what is potentially the most humorous iconic duo has been widely supported by McLaren fans. Some fans "can't wait for more of these two" in reference to the episode that occurred in the 2019 British GP press conference:

### Team Statements

McLaren CEO **Zak Brown** said that

> Signing Daniel is another step forward in our long-term plan and will bring an exciting new dimension to the team, alongside Lando. This is good news for our team, partners and of course our fans.

Zak Brown also added a thankful farewell by paying tribute to *Carlos Sainz Jr* : 

> I also want to pay tribute to Carlos for the excellent job he has been doing for McLaren in helping our performance recovery plan. He is a real team player and we wish him well for his future beyond McLaren.

Other members of the McLaren team are supportive of this decision and added how they felt about Ricciardo: 

> Daniel is a proven race-winner and his experience, commitment and energy will be a valuable addition to McLaren and our mission to return to the front of the field. With Daniel and Lando as teammates, I believe we have two racers who will continue to excite our fans and help the team grow.
