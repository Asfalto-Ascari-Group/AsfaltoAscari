# F1 2021 Car Tested in Wind Tunnel

We're just about to reach the second month since the FIA Youtube Channel [uploaded their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn2eisHLwwk "FIA Wind Tunnel Video") on the 2021 concept's first reveal of specs and tests which have taken place on the scale model. However, with the deadline for the technical rules of the 2021 season nearly reaching its deadline of October 31st, it may be insightful to recap on how the car looked in July and August.

Right off the bat we're shown the full half-side profile of the scale model in action in the wind tunnel, and there is much to be found upon looking at the car.

As the narrator says in the video:

> Using [a robotic rake] to measure airflow behind a 50% scale model of the 2021 car, the team could confirm their CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) findings in the wind tunnel. [The wake from behind an F1 car] can reduce the downforce by as much as 50% on today's cars. 2021 designs [only lose] 5-10% downforce.

This improvement in wake behind the cars can be awarded to the much simpler aerodynamics, which intend to lower the amount of vortices and disrupted airflow caused by the car pushing through the air. This can be seen from the image below, picturing the front wing and tyres.

This new front wing has removed most of the complex pieces of aero found on F1 cars. The cars feature much simpler flaps, with only 2 flaps and a main plane rather than an inner and outer third flap found at the top of each wing side. Moreover, the main plane and first & second flaps have been altered to create a much flatter and straighter design, removing the curves found on a 2019 car. However, the venturi channels found below each end plate remain on the car. However, this wing shape designed by Sauber is, according to the FIA's narration, not representative of the final design.

As the FIA states, the 2021 car will also feature 18inch wheels with low-profile tyres, creating a more aesthetically pleasing look while also improving road grip. The wheels will return to the era of wheel covers, which further assists airflow around the car and lowering any possible dirty air resulting from air passing through the inside of a wheel. There also features an upper tip over the tyres to prevent any air or dust getting kicked up by the tyre.

The new floor has also been showcased, with a more sleek and natural design, mostly void of aerodynamic parts. This is because of the new venturi tunnels under the car, returning F1 to the ground effect era between the 70s and 80s.

The car also sports an interesting wing design, which has been enlarged length-wise in comparison to the 2019 car. This reasoning according to FIA is to move the air higher up from behind the car - this could mean the dirty air from the wing essentially near-misses the car behind. The wing also assists with the ground effect tunnels under the car, making room and creating further points of airflow.

F1's new car also has the new sidepods, which have a slanted look to them, creating a sense of speed when looking at a car in a photo.
