McLaren has officially switched from Renault power to Mercedes power.

***CHASSI ISSUES***

When McLaren made the switch from Honda power to Renault power they had to deal with the issue of space: Where to put the new units?

[According to Lawrence Barretto, Senior Writer at formula1.com,](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.mclaren-confirm-switch-to-mercedes-power-in-2021-to-go-ahead-as-planned.10tnE3r9wYnQap4TUotwfZ.html)

> This would not be a problem if you were starting your chassis from scratch. But it is problematic if you are trying to fit it into an existing chassis, as substantial resource will be required to accommodate the switch.

> But McLaren have experience of such a challenge, having made a late call to swap from Honda to Renault power for 2018. They made it work. This time around, they have more time to find a way to make the unit sit comfortably.

We hope you are as excited as us to see what new and exciting possibilities this brings for both teams.
