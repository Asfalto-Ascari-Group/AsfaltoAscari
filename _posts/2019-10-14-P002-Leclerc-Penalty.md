# Charles Leclerc demoted twice to P7 in Japan for double race sanctions  

The FIA Stewards deemed Leclerc to be 'predominantly' at fault for the incident between Verstappen and himself and issued a five-second time penalty as well as two penalty points on his license. (Which then later **escalated to fifteen seconds** due to chain of event occurring.)

The stewards said in a statement:
> Car 33 [Verstappen], which was marginally in front, stayed wide and allowed sufficient room to the inside but car 16 lost front grip in the wake of the car in front and abruptly understeered towards the outside of the track, contacting car 33 and forcing it off the track.

> While the loss of front grip on car 16 [Leclerc] caused the contact and was not intentional, that loss of grip in close proximity to the car in front should have been anticipated and allowed for by car 16.

The collision itself issued a five second penalty but further sanctions were imposed on Leclerc for continuing to drive a lap further in an 'unsafe conditions' following the contact, which also involved an investigation on Ferrari.

One noted that :

>By not bringing car 16 into the pits at the end of lap 1, immediately after the incident for a safety inspection when there was damage clearly visible and then by telling the driver to remain out for an additional lap after telling the Race Director otherwise, the team created an unsafe condition on the circuit which only narrowly avoided being a major incident and also increased the likelihood of additional incidents

The collision between Leclerc and Verstappen in the first lap meant that the Monegasque had trouble with his front wing where later on a small piece of it broke off which allowed a chain-reaction for a larger piece to break off on the second lap hitting Hamilton's Mercedes.

As a result of the debris, Leclerc was given a further 10-second time penalty and his team Ferrari were fined â‚¬25,000.

The combined sanctions dropped him from P6 to P7, behind Renault's Daniel Riccardo.
